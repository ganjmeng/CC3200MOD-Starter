# CC3200MOD-Starter
Interfaces with the CC3200MOD with SmartConfig, mDNS, TCP Client, and command sending.

Originally intended as a temperature controller for home brewing.  In current state, includes very stable interface to the CC3200MOD microcontroller.  Though you'll still see a lot of references to the temperature controlling aspect.
